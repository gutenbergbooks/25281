<h2>Justinian at Windermere</h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">We</span> took a hundredweight of books<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Windermere between us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our dons had blessed our studious looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had they by chance but seen us.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Maine, Blackstone, Sandars, all were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Hallam's <i>Middle Ages</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Austin with his style so rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Poste's enticing pages.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We started well: the little inn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was deadly dull and quiet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dull as Mrs. Wood's <i>East Lynne</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or as the verse of Wyatt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Without distraction thus we read<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From nine until eleven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rowed and sailed until we fed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On potted char at seven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two hours of work! We could devote<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Next day to recreation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much illness springs, so doctors note,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From lack of relaxation.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let him read law on summer days,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who has a soul that grovels;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better one tale of Thackeray's<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than all Justinian's novels.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At noon we went upon the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We could not stand the slowness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our lone inn, so dined on steak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(They <i>called</i> it steak) at Bowness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We wrestled with the steak, when lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rose Jack in such a hurry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw a girl he used to know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In Suffolk or in Surrey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What matter which? to think that she<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should lure him from his duty!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Jack, I knew, would always be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A very slave to beauty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so it proved, alas! for Jack<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grew taciturn and thinner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was out all day alone, and back<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Too often late for dinner.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What could I do? His walks and rows<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All led to one conclusion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not read; our work, heaven knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was nothing but confusion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like Jack I went about alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Saw Wordsworth's writing-table,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made the higher by a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The "man" upon Great Gable.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last there came a sudden pause<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To all his wanderings <i>solus</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He learned what writers on the laws<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Rome had meant by <i>dolus</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Suffolk (was it Surrey?) flirt<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without a pang threw over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Jack and all his works like dirt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And caught a richer lover.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We read one morning more to say<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We had not been quite idle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then to end the arduous day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enjoyed a swim in Rydal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next day the hundredweight of books<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was packed once more in cases,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We left the lakes and hills and brooks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And southward turned our faces.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three months, and then the Oxford Schools;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our unbelieving college<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw better than ourselves what fools<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pretend sometimes to knowledge.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Curst questions! Jack did only one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He gave as his opinion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That of the Roman jurists none<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had lived before Justinian.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I answered two, but all I did<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was lacking in discretion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I reckoned guardianship amid<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <i>vitia</i> of possession.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My second shot was wider still,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I held that <i>commodata</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not attest a pr&aelig;tor's will<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because of <i>culpa lata</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We waited fruitlessly that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There came no blue <i>testamur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was Jack's heavy heart made light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By that sweet word <i>Amamur</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Since the above was written, the <i>testamur</i>, like many other institutions
dear to the old order of Oxford men, has been superseded.</p></div>

<h2>A Vision of Legal Shadows</h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">A case</span> at chambers left for my opinion<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had taxed my brain until the noon of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I read old law, and loathed the long dominion<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of fiction over right.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I had consulted Coke and Cruise and Chitty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The works where ancient learning reigns supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until exhausted nature, moved with pity,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Sent me a bookman's dream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Six figures, all gigantic as Gargantua,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Floated before my eyes, and all the six<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were shades like those that once the bard of Mantua<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Saw by the shore of Styx.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The first was one with countenance imperious,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His toga dim with centuries of dust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My name," quoth he, "is Aulus and Agerius,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i6">My voice is hoarse with rust.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet once I played my part in law proceedings,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And writers wrote of one they never saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave their point to formul&aelig; and pleadings,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">I lived but in the law."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The second had a countenance perfidious;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What wonder? Pr&aelig;tors launched their formul&aelig;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain against Numerius Negidius,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And not a whit cared he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With voice of high contempt he greeted Aulus;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"In interdicts thou wast mine enemy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once passed no day that students did not call us<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As parties, me and thee.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On paper I was plaintiff or defendant,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On paper thou wast evermore the same;<br /></span>

<span class="i6">For it was but a name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I hate thee, Aulus, hate thee," low he muttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"It was by thee that I was always tricked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My unsubstantial bread I ate unbuttered<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In dread of interdict.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And yet 'twas but the sentiment I hated:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With wine that was no wine my thirst was sated.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Two country hinds in 'broidered smocks next followed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each trundled him a cart-wheel by the spokes,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">For they were Stiles and Nokes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They spake no word, for speech to them was grievous,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Unlettered folk are we."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To whom in contradiction snarled the other,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">And we are shadows still."<br /></span>

by order of the Lord Keeper, for drawing a replication of sixscore
sheets containing much impertinent matter which might well have

that on the following Saturday the Warden of the Fleet should
cut a hole through the replication, and put the plaintiff's head
through the hole and let it hang about his shoulders with the
written side outwards, and lead the plaintiff bareheaded and
barefaced round about Westminster Hall, and show him at the
bar of all the courts, and so back to the Fleet.&mdash;Abridged from

<h3>WILLIS <i>v.</i> THE BISHOP OF OXFORD</h3>

<p class="center">(2 Probate Division, 192)</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Aid</span> me, Muses! my endeavour is to sing a woful song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How a very learned bishop in the Arches Court went wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aid me, for <i>duplex querela</i> is an uninviting theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the practice of the Arches raises no poetic dream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the Reverend Child Willis, child in name but not in age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes he to the Court of Arches burning with a noble rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filing his <i>duplex querela</i>, claiming for himself thereby<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vicarage of Drayton Parslow, or to know the reason why.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Reason why?" the bishop answers; "that is not so far to seek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little Latin have you, Willis, innocent are you of Greek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You were specially examined by my good Archdeacon Pott;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reported to me promptly, 'Greek and Latin all forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Non idoneus</i> is Willis, <i>minus et sufficiens</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He may have a <i>sanum corpus</i>, but he lacks a <i>sana mens</i>.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay," says Willis, "such an answer is but trifling with the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have preached a Latin sermon, and the classics are my forte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must name the books I failed in, you must give me every chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a fresh examination at the hands of Lord Penzance."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord Penzance supported Willis: "Bishop, you must file," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Some more tangible objection, some less vague and general plea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it stands I cannot gather what it is you ploughed him in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether Hellenistic aorists or the Latin word for sin."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But alas! the world has never known as yet what Willis did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the breast of the Archdeacon still it lies a secret hid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was his Latin prose defective? Did his style of writing show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More resemblance to Tertullian than to Tullius Cicero?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were his dates a little shaky? Could it, could it be that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confidently made Augustine flourish at a date <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None will know save Pott, Archdeacon, for alas! the patroness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed no mercy to Child Willis in the day of his distress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She revoked the presentation, leaving Willis in the lurch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of undisputed learning preached in Drayton Parslow church.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubly barren was his triumph, it was not a twelve-month ere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death set up <i>his</i> Court of Arches, Willis did not triumph there.<br /></span>

<h3>DASHWOOD <i>v.</i> JERMYN</h3>

<p class="center">(12 Chancery Division, 776)</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Captain Dashwood</span>, who had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the service of the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick of "Eyes front" and "Attention,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came to London on his pension.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the "Portland" as he stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm the friendship that he made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one William Richards, who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put up at the "Portland" too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed six years, then he was wrapped in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's embraces, vanquished captain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yes," he cried, "I will; no bar shall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stop my wedding Edith Marshall."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there was a bar, 'twas that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was poorer than a rat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indian pensions do not run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than just enough for one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Edith, too, had not a cent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would pay the rates and rent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two more years, and Richards moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(He perchance had sometime loved),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promised them an income clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas five hundred pounds a year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his life; when he was dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ten thousand pounds instead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This to Dashwood in a letter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrote he, deeming it was better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should marry soon while he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived their happiness to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a modest sum, but marriage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be blest without a carriage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forty pounds a month and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep the wolf from near the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they wed for worse or better,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the faith of Richards' letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarcely was a quarter's payment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Due when mourning was their raiment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Richards died. Alas! no cash would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find its way to Captain Dashwood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashwood's head began to swim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a shilling left to him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ha, I'll have it still," cried he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Justice dwells in Chancery."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the case was straightway taken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the court of V.-C. Bacon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vainly Dashwood cash expended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The executors defended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Claiming that what Richards wrote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not worth a five-pound note;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First because the dead testator<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, not wisely, loved the "cratur,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than that, had often been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In delirium tremens seen;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secondly, because he signed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he did not know his mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Third, because pollicitation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not good consideration.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Law, of justice independent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave its judgment for defendant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poorer than he was at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That unhappy plaintiff cursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a special satisfaction<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cursed the day he brought his action.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would that he'd in India tarried!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would that he had never married!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, alas, is tied for life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pauper to a pauper wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce consoled that on his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equity reports shower fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing down to endless ages<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashwood's story on their pages.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or like a garden planned by Paxton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or colophon designed by Caxton,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A dollar he had paid for Emma<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see a play, and not a hat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dollar, it was dear at that.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She never saw a single actor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Brown, with visage thunder-black,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The man who took the cash said, "Sonny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our rule is not to give back money.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you'll come another night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maybe you'll get a better sight."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Brown went home and nursed his sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His writ he issued on the morrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred dollars was his claim,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Had not deformed the law and eloquence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purge the tribune of all this monstrous growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mount it, and my soul will sink, though loth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will yield to fortune and will speak in prose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since reform in this so slowly grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave me my tastes, for I aspire to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By verse ennobled to posterity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold first place in arts above the law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More grave and noble than it ever saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fraud in this age of ours unpunished can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tread down the equity so dear to man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can you for spirits just and generous find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fairer cause to plead before mankind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother or stepmother let Fortune be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The theatre and not the bar for me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For client virtue, truth for counsel's wage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For judge the present and the coming age.<br /></span>
